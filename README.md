# ATM

🏧 ATM Simulation System (Mini C Project)

A simple ATM Simulation Project written in C, designed for beginners to understand file handling, loops, conditional statements, and menu-driven programs.
This project allows a user to log in with a PIN and perform basic ATM operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

# 🚀 Features

- 🔐 PIN Authentication
- 💰 Check Account Balance
- ➕ Deposit Money
- ➖ Withdraw Money
- 💾 Data Saved in File (balance.txt)
- 📁 Beginner-Friendly Code Structure

# 📁 Project Structure

- atm/
  ├── atm.c
  └── balance.txt

atm.c → Main program file

balance.txt → Stores the current balance

If balance.txt is missing, the program automatically starts with balance = 0.

# 🧠 Concepts Used

- File Handling (fopen, fscanf, fprintf)
- Loops (while)
- Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
- Functions
- Basic input/output in C

* Compile the program - gcc atm.c -o atm
* Run the program - ./atm

# 🔐 Default Login PIN

1234

# 🛠 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Here are improvements you can add to make it more advanced:

- ✔ Multi-user accounts with individual PINs
- ✔ Transaction receipt system
- ✔ Password masking (****)
- ✔ Transaction history
- ✔ Admin panel

If you want, I can build any of these for you.
